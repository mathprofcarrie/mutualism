# Theoretical models of obligate mutualism to link micro- with macro-coevolutionary dynamics

## Description
This repository contains the code used to reproduce *Theoretical models of obligate mutualism to link micro- with macro-coevolutionary dynamics* by Carrie Diaz Eaton and Chris Moore. The `Code` folder has code for both running the simulations from the study (`[ insert filenames]`) written in MatLab and the figures from the study (four files with `Fig` prefix) written in R. The data generated from the simulation are found in the `Data` folder as `.csv`s. If one would like to reproduce the figures without running the simulation, then they can use the files in the `Data` folder.
